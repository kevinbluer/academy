# Welcome!
  
Hello and welcome to ConsenSys Academyâ€™s Blockchain Developer Bootcamp, where you will learn everything you need to know to become a world-class blockchain developer.
      
The blockchain field develops at an incredibly fast pace. [MORE HERE ABOUT WHAT THE RAPID PACE REQUIRES FROM DEVELOPERS, IE continous onboarding]. This course will give you a solid foundation of blockchain principles. It will also introduce you to the tools used to build blockchain projects today. It can be overwhelming to enter such a rapidly developing field.

With that in mind, this course aims to teach from [a first principles approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#Aristotle's_contribution).
